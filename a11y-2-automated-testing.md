# A11y 2 of 3 — What the automated tests cover, and what they cannot

**App:** VW Cost Simulator (`cost-simulator`).
**Audited:** 2026-08-22 against the live deployment, headless Chrome 151.0.7922.174, axe-core 4.13.0
(`axe.version` read from the engine, not the bundle filename).
**Deployed at:** https://yikcunchung.github.io/vw-cost-simulator-prototype/
**Companions:** `a11y-1-criteria.md` (every criterion) · `a11y-3-implementation.md` (what to build).

The single most important sentence in this pack:

> **A clean automated run is necessary and nowhere near sufficient.** This app scores 0 axe
> violations, 0 WAVE errors and 0 HTML validity errors — and that result could not see the
> unnamed-graphic defect that the accessibility tree found, cannot test SC 2.5.3, cannot judge
> whether a name is *correct* rather than merely present, and cannot tell you what a screen reader
> actually says.

# 0. Scope of this evidence — read before quoting a number

This app is a **standalone page**, so `axe.run(document)` covers the whole conformance surface.
There is no component-versus-page split.

The local `index.html` and the deployed build are **byte-identical**.

# 1. Tool coverage at a glance

| Tool | Good for | Blind spots that matter here |
|---|---|---|
| **axe-core 4.13.0** | Structural ARIA, names, roles, contrast on solid backgrounds | **No `label-in-name` rule at all** (SC 2.5.3). **Cannot see an unnamed inline `<svg>` that has no `role`** — trap 10. Cannot see behaviour. Punts on contrast over gradients. **Nine rules are off by default, including `target-size`** — trap 1 |
| **WAVE 3.3.1.0** | A genuinely different engine; catches empty labels and sr-only contrast axe passes | Needs a public URL. Reports `.sr-only` contrast as an error even when clipped to 1×1 |
| **Nu HTML validator** | SC 4.1.1 Parsing, still normative under EN 301 549 | Says nothing about semantics or naming |
| **Accessibility tree (CDP)** | Ground truth for name / role / value | Exposure is not announcement — §5 |
| **Real key and pointer events** | The only way to test behaviour | Slow; assert state after every event |

## Required toolchain — coverage against it

| Required | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **axe DevTools 4.12.1** | ✅ **Done — UI at WCAG 2.2 AA** | Automated scan (default + info-modal-open states), Interactive Elements, and Forms guided tests all run — every AI-flagged item was a false positive (a decorative header icon with a correct empty `alt`, a disabled `battery-select` flagged as a keyboard-access failure when disabled-on-purpose is the point, a value-readout `<span>` misjudged as needing its own tab stop, and one internally-inconsistent finding where the tool's own highlight and reasoning referred to different elements) — §9.3 |
| **WAVE Evaluation Tool 3.3.1.0** | ✅ **Done — hosted and extension, both states** | Hosted engine via `wave.webaim.org/report#/<url>`; extension pass confirmed **0 errors, 0 contrast errors** in both the default state and the info-modal-open state — §9.2 |
| **Zoom 400% and 320 × 256 px** | ✅ **Done** | `320×256 @ deviceScaleFactor 4`. **dsf 1 is a small screen, not a zoomed one** |
| **Operated via the keyboard** | ✅ **Done** | Driven with real `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` |
| **NVDA 2026.1.1.55980** | ❌ **Not done** | The one real screen-reader gap. **VoiceOver has been run — §9.1** — a deviation, not a substitute |
| **PAC 26.1.0.0** | ⚪ **Not applicable** | PAC checks PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1). This app ships no PDFs (`*.pdf` count: 0). If brochures or price lists are added they are a separate surface under EN 301 549 clause 10 |

### NVDA vs VoiceOver — a deviation to record

VoiceOver is planned instead of NVDA. Record that as a **deviation**, not a substitution. The two
disagree exactly where this app is interesting: a `<select>` named via `aria-labelledby`, live-region
politeness, and controls built from a visually hidden `<input>` behind a styled `<label>`. NVDA is
normally tested with Firefox or Chrome, VoiceOver with Safari, so the browser differs too. Budget an
NVDA pass before formal sign-off.

# 2. Results

## axe-core — 0 violations

Bare `axe.run(document)` plus the default-disabled rules force-enabled (98 rules).
Viewports: 1440×900, 768×1024, 390×844, 320×640, and 320×256 @ dsf 4 (literal 400% zoom).

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Rules executed | 98 |
| Violations | **0** at every viewport |
| `target-size` | **passes 22 nodes**, 0 violations, 0 incomplete |
| JS exceptions | **0** |
| Horizontal scroll | none, at any viewport |

## Accessibility tree

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Nodes (1440×900) | 426 |
| Named interactive / graphic nodes | 43 |
| **Unnamed** | **0** |
| Focusable controls | 21 |

> **This is where the one real defect was found.** Before the fix, **9 `role=image` nodes were exposed unnamed** — invisible to axe, WAVE and Nu alike. See trap 10.

## WAVE 3.3.1.0 — real engine, public URL

| Errors | Contrast errors | Alerts | Features | Structure | ARIA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | **0** | 0 | 29 | 3 | 45 |

The run was confirmed to have analysed the real page — control count and document title were read
back out of WAVE's iframe, not assumed.

## Nu HTML validator — 0 errors

SC 4.1.1 Parsing. Obsolete in WCAG 2.2 but normative under EN 301 549 (clause 9.4.1.1), so it is
checked and kept.

## Contrast — the `incomplete` bucket resolved by hand

axe punts whenever the background is a gradient, an image, or overlapped. Those are **not passes** —
a BITV tester must resolve every one. At 1440×900 there were **36**.

33 are "bgGradient" from the `linear-gradient` on `.input-section`; the rest are "bgOverlap" caused by `span.slot-reel`, the animated digit roller, which is laid out 33x560 and geometrically overlaps neighbouring text.

**Every one resolves to a pass.** Measured on composited pixels: viewport screenshot, cropped in PIL
with viewport-relative coordinates, foreground taken from the glyph band and background from the
dominant colour of a second capture with the text forced transparent. **Worst ratio anywhere:
6.19:1**, against a 4.5:1 requirement (every element is 16px or smaller, so the 3:1
large-text threshold never applies).

## Orientation and text spacing

**SC 1.3.4 Orientation — pass.** No `@media (orientation:)` rule exists anywhere in the app.

**SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing — pass.** With all four overrides applied (`line-height:1.5`,
`letter-spacing:0.12em`, `word-spacing:0.16em`, `p margin-bottom:2em`) at 1440 / 390 / 320:
**no newly clipped element, no control lost, no horizontal scroll.**

> **One nuance the detector accounts for.** The trim-select and battery-select floating labels
> ("Model: The new ID.3 Neo" / "Motor / Battery Capacity") do still visually truncate at some
> widths under these overrides. That is not counted as loss: each select's `<option>`s are wrapped
> in an `<optgroup>` whose `label` matches the truncated string exactly, so opening the select —
> its own normal operation — reveals the same text in full. A label whose content has no such
> match inside its own control (there is none here) would still fail this check.

> **Detector validated.** A canary that fits at the default line-height and overflows only at 1.5
> was injected and *was* detected. A first canary was already clipped before the override and
> therefore proved nothing — "no new clipping" is worthless unless you have watched the detector fire.

# 3. Validate the harness before trusting a zero

Every axe detector was re-run against the page with that defect injected:

| Injected defect | Rule | Fired |
|---|---|---|
| `<button>` with no accessible name | `button-name` | ✅ |
| `<img>` with no `alt` | `image-alt` | ✅ |
| Text at ~1.2:1 | `color-contrast` | ✅ |
| Two elements sharing an `id` | `duplicate-id` | ✅ |
| `<input>` with no label | `label` | ✅ |
| `<a href>` with no text | `link-name` | ✅ |
| Two adjacent 12×12 buttons | `target-size` | ✅ |

**`target-size` first appeared to miss, and that was the harness's fault.** The canaries had been
injected at `position:fixed; top:0; left:0` — underneath the sticky topbar, so axe treated them as
obscured — and only `violations` was read. In normal flow the rule fires on both nodes. Traps 1 and 2.

---

# 4. Ten traps that produce a confident false pass

**1 · Bare `axe.run()` is not every rule.** Nine rules are `enabled:false` by default in axe-core
4.13.0: **`target-size`** (SC 2.5.8), `aria-roledescription`, `color-contrast-enhanced`,
`duplicate-id`, `duplicate-id-active`, `identical-links-same-purpose`,
`landmark-complementary-is-top-level`, `meta-refresh-no-exceptions`, `audio-caption`. A stock run
reports "0 violations" **without ever having tested target size**. Pass
`{rules:{'target-size':{enabled:true}, …}}` and confirm the rule appears in `passes`. Check
`axe._audit.rules.filter(r => !r.enabled)` before believing a rule ran.

**2 · `violations` is not the whole result.** `incomplete` is the "needs review" bucket a BITV or
EN 301 549 tester must resolve by hand. It is also where an *obscured* element lands — so a
genuinely undersized target can be missing from `violations` because axe could not decide, not
because it passed.

**3 · `runOnly: {type:'tag'}` is not "all rules".** A tag filter silently skips every rule without
one of those tags.

**4 · 400% zoom is `deviceScaleFactor: 4`.** `320×256 @ dsf 1` is a small screen — a different test,
and not the one 1.4.4 asks for.

**5 · WAVE reads stale counts.** Poll until the icon counts go **stable**, not until
`wave.report.iconlist` merely exists. Reading early returns the *previous* page's numbers. Also
`iconlist.error` is `{description, count, items}`, not a map — summing it as a map yields a false
all-zero clean pass.

**6 · `Page.captureScreenshot` clip is document-absolute.** `getBoundingClientRect()` is
viewport-relative. Mixing them photographs a blank region: the element scores exactly `1.00:1` with
one unique colour. **A ratio of exactly 1.00 means the clip missed, not that contrast failed.**

**7 · Anti-aliasing is not the background, and neither is a border.** Taking the *worst* minority
colour in a text crop reports white-on-dark text as a failure — it has found the element's own
border. Crop to the **glyph band** (union of `Range.getClientRects()`), or the padding box for a
`<select>`, and use the **dominant** background.

**8 · A `<select>`'s options are not its label.** Comparing concatenated `<option>` text against the
accessible name manufactures SC 2.5.3 failures that do not exist. Compare the associated `<label>`.

**9 · `Network.setCacheDisabled` is a no-op unless `Network.enable` was called first.** Re-auditing
after an edit then silently re-measures the *old* page and reports the defect as unfixed. Enable the
domain, or append a cache-busting query string.

**10 · axe is blind to unnamed inline SVGs.** `svg-img-alt` and `role-img-alt` return
**`inapplicable`** for an `<svg>` with no `role`, and `image-alt` only inspects `<img>`. A page can
expose any number of unnamed graphics and still score 0 violations. **Read `role=image` nodes off
the AX tree and assert 0 unnamed** — that is how every unnamed-graphic failure in this suite was
found, and neither axe nor WAVE nor Nu saw any of them.

---

# 5. What automation will never close

**Real screen-reader/AI-guided output requires a human pass.** The accessibility tree confirms what
is *exposed*; NVDA, JAWS and VoiceOver differ in what they *announce*. VoiceOver, WAVE, and axe
DevTools have now all been run manually — §9. **NVDA remains the one outstanding instrument.**

**A name can be present, unique, and wrong.** Every automated check here passes on a control
labelled "button". Names must be read against what they describe.

**SC 2.5.3 Label in Name has no axe rule.** It was checked by hand — see `a11y-1-criteria.md`.

---

# 6. Manual testing — what to do

**All three manual runs (VoiceOver, WAVE, axe DevTools) have now been run — results in §9. NVDA
remains outstanding** — §1.

**The reusable procedure (Step 0, VoiceOver/WAVE/axe DevTools runs, sign-off checklist) lives
centrally** in `../audit-evidence/manual-testing-guide.md` — it's identical across all five sibling
apps, so it's maintained once there instead of copied per app. What follows here is only what's
specific to cost-simulator.

## App-specific Step 0

- **Live** — `https://yikcunchung.github.io/vw-cost-simulator-prototype/`.
- **Confirm on screen:** 5 info-modal triggers (`info-btn-location`, `info-btn-distance`,
  `info-btn-miles`, `info-btn-fuel`, `info-btn-cost`), the distance-distribution block (home/work/
  public step sliders), the miles slider, price inputs with edit-icon buttons, and the trim/battery
  selects.
- **29 Tab stops** (raised from an earlier count of 22 after the edit-icon affordances became real
  focusable buttons this session — re-verify this count live before trusting it).

## App-specific notes for the central procedure's Run 2 (WAVE)

- Confirmed **0 errors, 0 contrast errors** in both the default state and the info-modal-open state
  — §9.2.

# 7. Verification checklist

Tick only what you actually observed against the central sign-off checklist in
`../audit-evidence/manual-testing-guide.md`. **An untested box is not a pass.**

---

# 8. Re-running the automated suite

Identical across all five sibling apps — see `../audit-evidence/manual-testing-guide.md` for the
CDP re-run script (serve locally, drive headless Chrome over the CDP protocol, run axe/AX-tree/
reflow/text-spacing/WAVE checks, diff local against live). Substitute this app's own port and live
URL where the script needs them.

**Automate the structural half in CI, but do not mistake it for the whole.** A structural-only suite
is exactly what scores clean on a build with a Level A naming failure.

---

# 9. Manual run results

## 9.1 Screen reader — VoiceOver / Safari, complete

VoiceOver Run 1 completed against the live build: full Tab-order walk (29 stops, skip link through
the CTA button — the four location rows' step-thumb/price-input/edit-icon sequence, the miles
slider, trim-select with battery-select correctly disabled/skipped on the default Trend trim), all
5 info-modals (open/read/close via all three methods, focus returns to the trigger correctly), and
the rotor sweep (Form Controls, Headings — 1 real `<h1>` matches the code, Landmarks). All clear, no
findings. One real parity gap found and fixed along the way (not a VoiceOver defect per se, but
surfaced during this pass): the distance-distribution thumbs (`dist-thumb-1`/`dist-thumb-2`) only
announced their own single segment (e.g. "33% city"), unlike range-simulator's identical component,
which announces both neighbouring segments. Corrected to match — see `a11y-3-implementation.md`.

## 9.2 WAVE 3.3.1.0 — extension, complete

Extension pass against the live build reported **0 errors, 0 contrast errors** in both the default
state and the info-modal-open state.

## 9.3 axe DevTools 4.12.1 — automated scan + Interactive Elements + Forms, complete

All run against the live build. Findings, all false positives:
- **Automated scan (default state):** 1× "Informative images must have accessible names" on
  `.sim-header-icon` (`alt=""`) — a small decorative glyph beside the already-fully-descriptive
  page headline. `alt=""` is the correct marking for a decorative image, not a bug.
- **Automated scan (info-modal-open state):** 0 issues.
- **Interactive Elements guided test:** 3 items examined — `battery-select` (disabled on the
  default Trend trim, correctly excluded from keyboard access), a `<span class="label-freq">`
  value-readout for a step-slider (not a separate control, just a text mirror of the real
  slider's already-focusable value), and one finding where the tool's highlighted element
  (`battery-select`) didn't match its own written reasoning (which described a completely
  different "mileage" control) — an internal tool inconsistency, not evaluable as a real or
  false finding either way.
- **Forms guided test:** clear.

**A real, non-axe-flagged gap was found and fixed during this pass** (via a real-production DOM
comparison, not any automated tool): the distance-distribution thumbs (`dist-thumb-1`/
`dist-thumb-2`) exposed a static `aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"` regardless of the other
thumb's position, when the actual operable range is bounded by it (neither thumb can cross the
other). The real core component dynamically narrows this. Fixed to match, and the `aria-label`s
were also aligned to range-simulator's naming ("City / Country road split" / "Country road /
Motorway split") — see `a11y-3-implementation.md`.

## 9.4 Outstanding

**NVDA 2026.1.1.55980** — not yet run; see the deviation note in §1. Required before formal
BITV/EN 301 549 sign-off.
