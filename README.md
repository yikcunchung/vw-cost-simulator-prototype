# VW Cost Simulator — accessibility reference build

A working, WCAG 2.2 AA reference build. **It is a behavioural specification, not source to copy.** The defects that shipped here were invisible to every automated tool — they were found only by reading the accessibility tree.

**Live:** https://yikcunchung.github.io/vw-cost-simulator-prototype/

## If you are the developer porting this — read this section only

You need **six things**. Everything else in this repo is evidence for auditors.

### 1. 9 inline SVGs must be aria-hidden or named

```
<!-- decorative -->
<svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">…</svg>
```

**Why:** The 9 decorative SVGs shipped unnamed. Chrome maps a bare <svg> to role=image with an empty name.

> axe returns inapplicable for an <svg> without a role. The AX-tree assertion proves it.

### 2. Every slider is keyboard operable and exposes its value

```
thumb.setAttribute("role", "slider");
thumb.setAttribute("aria-valuenow", current);
thumb.setAttribute("aria-valuetext", current + " p/kWh");
thumb.addEventListener("keydown", e => { /* arrows, Home, End */ });
```

**Why:** 6 of 11 pointer widgets had no keyboard equivalent. 10 button-based thumbs had role=button, no value, no key handler.

> role=button is wrong for a slider thumb. The valuetext is what a screen reader reads.

### 3. Visible label text must appear in the accessible name

```
<!-- ✓ aria-labelledby points at the visible label -->
<label id="motor-label">Motor / Battery Capacity</label>
<select aria-labelledby="motor-label">…</select>
```

**Why:** SC 2.5.3: visible "Motor / Battery Capacity" against aria-label "Motor and battery capacity" — the "/" became "and". axe has no label-in-name rule and returned 0 violations.

> Use aria-labelledby for any control with a visible label. Never retype the label into aria-label.

### 4. Animated digit reels must be aria-hidden; publish the real value as text

```
<div class="slot-reel" aria-hidden="true">…</div>
<p class="sr-only" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"></p>
```

**Why:** The headline figure was exposed as 42 characters — "£0123456789,012345678…" — instead of "£2,119".

> Six figures update simultaneously. One live region, one writer. Clear it after ~3s.

### 5. Alt text must describe the specific image shown

```
// ✓ reassign alt whenever src changes
img.src = variant.src;
img.alt = "Volkswagen " + variant.name + ", front three-quarter view";
```

**Why:** The car image carried alt="Volkswagen" — a name that was present but described nothing about the actual vehicle or variant.

> A present-but-wrong alt passes axe. SC 1.1.1 requires an equivalent, not merely a non-empty string.

### 6. Every focusable control has a visible focus ring

```
.fl-select select:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid #C86C03; }
.spin-btn:focus-visible    { outline: 2px solid #C86C03; }
```

**Why:** 9 of 20 focus stops painted zero indicator pixels.

> Never remove outline without a named replacement.

## How you know you are done

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

**180 tests over 4 viewports.** They encode all six rules above plus the scanner checks. Green means you have it.

> **These six exist because every one of them was invisible to axe, WAVE and Nu.**

## A deliberate departure from the core component

The real core Select/Button border, `rgb(161,164,172)`, is **2.29:1** against the page — below the
3:1 SC 1.4.11 floor. This build uses `rgb(110,116,126)` (**4.32:1**) instead: darker than the core
value on purpose, so the prototype demonstrates full outright compliance rather than reproducing a
known upstream contrast bug. Do not "correct" it back toward `rgb(161,164,172)` — that direction was
tried and reverted.
